# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my repository for practicing various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions in preparation for interviews.

## Description

This repository contains implementations of different data structures and algorithms in Python. Each file addresses a specific DSA problem, covering topics such as dynamic programming, sorting, searching, graph algorithms, and more.
