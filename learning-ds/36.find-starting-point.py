##In this version, trace_path first creates a reverse dictionary of the given dictionary. Then it finds the starting point of the journey by checking which city is not a key in the reverse dictionary. Finally, it constructs the journey by following the path from the starting city to the next city in the dictionary until it reaches a city that is not a key in the dictionary. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), which is more efficient than the previous solution.

def trace_path(my_dict):
    
    # Replace this placeholder return statement with your code
    reverse_dict = dict()
    for key in my_dict:
        reverse_dict[my_dict[key]] = key 

    ## find starting point
    from_loc = None
    for key in my_dict:
        if key not in reverse_dict:
            from_loc = key 

    output_list = []
    to = my_dict[from_loc]
    while to:
        output_list.append([from_loc, to])
        from_loc = to 
        to = my_dict.get(to)

    return output_list
